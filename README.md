# Meditációs Hétvége Eger

Mobile-first registration for the Meditációs Hétvége weekend, 9-11 October 2026 (originally built
for the 8. Karmapa weekend, 25-27 September 2026). Separate pages:

- **`/` Jelentkezés / Register** (the link to share): name, diet, and a switch for each meal and night. No email. After saving, people see a summary and can edit or cancel from the same phone.
- **`resztvevok.html` Résztvevők / Attendees:** the number of attendees and a plain list of names. No prices, no filters. People get an edit link only next to entries made on their own phone; organisers fix anything else in the Google Sheet.
- **`konyha.html` Konyha / Kitchen:** total attendees, meat and vegetarian, then per day how many people eat (anyone with at least one meal that day), split into meat and vegetarian. No money, no names.
- **`program.html` Program:** the weekend schedule.

Every page switches between Hungarian and English.

Prices: dinner and lunch 1 800 Ft, breakfast 1 000 Ft, accommodation 2 000 Ft per night (Friday and Saturday).

The page checks for changes every 10 seconds and whenever it comes back into view, so everyone sees new registrations without reloading.

## How the shared data works

GitHub Pages only serves static files, so the registrations live in a Google Sheet owned by the organiser. A small Google Apps Script (`apps-script/Code.gs`) reads and writes that sheet. It is connected (`config.js` holds the web app URL); with an empty `API_URL` the page falls back to demo mode and keeps data on the visitor's own device.

### Connecting the Google Sheet (one time, about 5 minutes)

1. Create a new Google Sheet, for example "Meditációs Hétvége Eger jelentkezések".
2. In the sheet: **Extensions → Apps Script**. Delete the sample code, paste the whole of `apps-script/Code.gs`, and save.
3. **Deploy → New deployment**. Click the gear icon, choose **Web app**.
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**
4. Click **Deploy**, then **Authorize access** and allow it with your Google account.
5. Copy the **Web app URL** (it ends in `/exec`) and put it in `config.js` as `API_URL`.

The sheet fills itself: one row per person, meal columns show the price when booked, plus a total. You can also fix rows by hand in the sheet; the page picks the changes up.

If you change `Code.gs` later, use **Deploy → Manage deployments → Edit → New version** so the URL stays the same.

## Development

No build step. Serve the folder with any static server, for example `python3 -m http.server`.

```
npm test
```

runs the price, per-day and summary calculations, and the Apps Script backend against an in-memory sheet.
